# Inspiration and future improvement
The idea for the project was inspired by this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Wa57T2jVRU. This is a very simple web application. My concept was to create inspirational images with those quotes in web, using API to fetch quotes. For now however I was unable to find suitable Quote API for this task, so I scramble the project untill I create my own.
